      Tip 1.<br><br>
       When you are mining, make sure that you don't dig straight down.
       This will increase the likelyhood of you falling into lava and losing all of your progress.<br><br>
       Instead of digging straight down, you should create stairs so that you can see where you're going before you go there.

      Tip 2.<br><br>
      Sometimes you want to cook or smelt a large amount of material such as beef to turn into steak or sand to burn into glass.
      Because you need a furnace and a lot of fuel for this task, being fuel efficient is a very important skill.<br><br>
      You can cook with coal or any other hot or flammable material. Here are the best resources to use: wooden plank, coal, blaze rod, and lava bucket.

      Tip 3.<br><br>
      If you want to do a bit more damage when attacking mobs, try doing a critical hit.<br>
      While falling, melee attacks deal a critical hit, which deals out 150% of the weapon's damage including potion effects.<br><br>
      This will allow you to kill enemies much faster, therfore decreasing your likelyhood of dying.

      Tip 4. <br><br>
      Mining in the right location is necessary for finding diamonds and rare ores. <br>
      Denser ores such as redstone and diamond appear deep underground, but theyâ€™re statistically common about 10 blocks above the bedrock layer.
      However, this spot is also abundant in lava, which you can (mostly) evade by remaining 11 blocks above bedrock.
