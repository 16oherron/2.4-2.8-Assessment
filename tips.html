      Tip 1.<br><br>
       When you are mining, make sure that you don't dig straight down.
       This will increase the likelyhood of you falling into lava and losing all of your progress.<br><br>
       Instead of digging straight down, you should create stairs so that you can see where you're going before you go there.

      Tip 2.<br><br>
      Sometimes you want to cook or smelt a large amount of material such as beef to turn into steak or sand to burn into glass.
      Because you need a furnace and a lot of fuel for this task, being fuel efficient is a very important skill.<br><br>
      You can cook with coal or any other hot or flammable material. Here are the best resources to use: coal, coal blocks, blaze rods, and lava buckets.

      Tip 3.<br><br>
      If you want to do a bit more damage when attacking mobs, try doing a critical hit.<br>
      While falling, melee attacks deal a critical hit, which deals out 150% of the weapon's <br>
      damage including potion effects.<br><br>
      This will allow you to kill enemies much faster, therfore decreasing your likelyhood of dying.

      Tip 4. <br><br>
      Mining in the right location is necessary for finding diamonds and rare ores. <br>
      Denser ores such as redstone and diamond appear deep underground, but they’re statistically common about 10 blocks above the bedrock layer.
      However, this spot is also abundant in lava, which you can (mostly) evade by remaining 11 blocks above bedrock.

      Tip 5. <br><br>
      Stock up on experience whenever you can. <br>
      A large quantity of experience is an exremely uselful thing to have. It allows you to enchant your gear to make it much more useful in battle or when collecting resources.
      Experience can also be used to repair your gear when it's durability has lowered with the use of an enchantment called mending. <br><br>
      The best ways to gain experience are: defeating mobs, smelting large quantities of items, and mining nether quartz.

      Tip 6. <br><br>
      Find treasure and loot wherever you can. <br>
      There are some very good sources of treasure that you can find throughout the world, these include sand and jungle temples, villages, <br>
      shipwrecks, abandoned mineshafts, strongholds, woodland mansions, and treasure chests.
      These chests contain many rare items such as gold, diamonds, saddles, name tags, and many more for you to find.
